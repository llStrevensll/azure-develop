Networking,

So a subnet is again a logical separation of the address space of the virtual Network.
Then we have a public IP address, so the public IP address allows this virtual machine to be reachable 
from the Internet.
So let's say that you want to go ahead and connect to this virtual machine. will actually connect to this virtual
machine via the public IP address

Accelerated networking
 Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance. This high-performance path bypasses the host from the data path, which reduces latency, jitter, 
 and CPU utilization for the most demanding network workloads on supported VM types. The following diagram illustrates how two VMs communicate with and without accelerated networking:
